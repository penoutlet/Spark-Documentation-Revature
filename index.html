<!-- TODO 1
For the first part of your documentation website, create one or more webpages that serve as a user manual for your application.

These pages should contain screenshots of your application, illustrating step-by-step how users can use the different features and functionalities you've built out. Make sure these instructions are separated and presented in a logical and easy-to-follow manner. -->

<!-- Header for the page, paragraph describing the program, and then several headers describing the functionality - creating accounts, viewing accounts, and withdrawing and depositing funds -->
<h1> Application Features: Learning with a Tutorial</h1>

<h2> Application Overview </h2>
<p> This is a banking application, where users can create and view accounts, as well as withdraw and deposit funds. Follow along with the instructions on this page to familiarize yourself with the available features. </p>

<h3> Tutorial </h3>
<ol>
	<li><p>Once the application is running, you will see the interface below. </p> <p> To begin, click "Create account," and create a checking account.
 </p></li>

</li>
<li><p> Select "View accounts," selecting a minimum balance of 30000 that will return the checking account. </p>
<p>Voila, both accounts have balances that match the initial funds, with withdrawals and deposits included. </p>

<!-- TODO 2 
Now that you have a user manual built, it's time to document your code. Using the JavaDoc as a guide, create several web pages to document your Java classes and code. For the purposes of this project, you only need to document code that you have written, not code from the starter kit.

Like the JavaDoc, each class and interface you build should have its own page. Each page should document the public and protected variables and methods available for other developers to access. Each method should have a brief writeup detailing the parameters it receives, what it does, it's output, and any possible exceptions thrown.

Where possible, include links to the pages for other related classes or methods. Again, use the JavaDoc as a guide. -->
